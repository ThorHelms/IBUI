# IBUI

**I**nterface-**B**ased **UI** for Unity3D is a small helper-library meant for
creating the functional parts of a UI in Unity3D. Everything is implemented via
interfaces, hence the name. This makes it very loosely coupled, and thus easy to
extend: You can add your own implementations of the various interfaces and
replace the default implementations with your own, and thus control the
behavior to a very high degree.

If you just want to get started, see the
[Quick-start guide](Docs/QUICK-START.md), which also contains documentation on
the IBUI component menu.

Otherwise, you can read the documentation on the
[interfaces](Docs/INTERFACES.md) or the
[default implementation](Docs/DEFAULT-IMPLEMENTATION.md).


## Roadmap
